<h4>1.Injury Risks</h4>
<p style="color:green;text-align:justify;width:80%;margin-left:40px;font-size:20px;">
Yoga, as a form of exercise, has to be done the right way and in moderation. Otherwise it increases risks of injury (2).

When a student and even a teacher has low muscle strength or any other form of physical weakness, then they put themselves at a greater risk of sustaining a serious injury by doing the physical postures.  Furthermore, quick movements and poses that extend the neck or those that stretch the vertebrae extensively can cause brain injuries.
<h4>2. Age Considerations</h4>
<p style="color:green;text-align:justify;width:80%;margin-left:40px;font-size:20px;">
Doing Yoga on an everyday basis has tremendously positive effects on the body and mind – it builds strength, stamina, mobility, flexibility, mental resilience, patience, humility, peace, just to mention a few. This however depends on various factors connected to the physical condition, overall health, previous training experience, and many more. One of the most determinative of them is the age of the practitioner.

Although yoga is suited to people of all ages, certain styles are more appropriate for the elderly than others, so it is of great importance to choose the right yoga class for yourself.
<h4>3. Health-related Threats</h4>
<p style="color:green;text-align:justify;width:80%;margin-left:40px;font-size:20px;">
The section above examined in-depth the growing challenges we’re facing with every year passing. It is of no surprise that with age we need to be careful in our physical activity and more considerate of our health state. With that in mind, this section aims at expanding the topic by covering other health issues that might arise from practicing yoga or be worsened by it.
<h4>4. Dehydration</h4>
<p style="color:green;text-align:justify;width:80%;margin-left:40px;font-size:20px;">
As mentioned above, Bikram Yoga might be hazardous to you due to the high temperatures in the room which increase the risk of dehydration and heatstroke. Sweat is the natural reaction of the body to heat and humidity and its purpose is to cool us down. But under the conditions of an environment where the temperature reaches 41 degrees Celsius and humidity levels of approximately 40%, the sweat doesn’t evaporate as quickly as it generates and it only adds on. This increases the risk of dehydration and heat exhaustion especially if you haven’t consumed enough fluids before and during the class.
<h4>5. Loss of Confidence or Enthusiasm</h4>
<p style="color:green;text-align:justify;width:80%;margin-left:40px;font-size:20px;">
Difficult yoga poses are hard to learn and take time and constant practice. Impatience and attempts to execute them prematurely most probably will result in failure and demotivation. For as much as yoga claims to quell the ego, the classes abound with competitiveness. That’s why choosing the right yoga class is so important. If you enroll in a more advanced program compared to your current physical level and abilities, this might result in you feeling discouraged and eventually quitting yoga all in all. Those are the psychological consequences of mismatching your level and the yoga class you attend. </P>
