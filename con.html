The purpose of Yoga is to create harmony in the physical, vital, mental, psychological and spiritual aspects of the human being. In the foregoing pages of this book, I have described the Technique of relaxation in different postures viz., standing, lying and sitting postures which brings in this harmony. Yoga is not mere practice for an hour or two in a day but it is the most scientific way of living, all the twenty-four hours of the day. During the whole day you may be only in one of these three postures and hence a skilful adjustment in them will effect the required harmony. "Yogasthah Kuru Karmani- Be established in Yoga and do all your duties." "Yogah karmasu Kausalam-Yoga is skill in action." Skill here means to be in tune with the nature of the Supreme Reality. Be a Yogin always, is the loving instruction of Lord Krishna. Convert life into Yoga, so that you may ensure success in all the fields of activity. By regular practice, by using your presence of mind, skill and wisdom, you can become Yogins and enjoy happiness and peace, whatever be the circumstances and conditions in which you are placed.

May the Grace of Gurudev Sri Swami Sivanandaji Maharaj and the Almighty be ever upon you all!</p>
